# Proposed Feature Enhancements for Invoicer AI

Here are three potential feature ideas to enhance the Invoicer AI application, building upon its current voice-to-invoice capabilities.

**Feature 1: Invoice Management Dashboard**

*Purpose & Benefits:* This dashboard will serve as a centralized hub for users to view, track, and manage all their created invoices. It aims to improve organization, provide better tracking of invoice statuses, save time through search/filtering, and offer a more complete user experience beyond just invoice creation.

*Key Functionalities:*
    *   View a sortable and paginated list of all invoices with key details (number, client, dates, amount, status).
    *   Search invoices by keywords (e.g., client name, invoice number).
    *   Filter invoices by status (e.g., draft, sent, paid) and date ranges.

**Feature 2: PDF Export and Emailing of Invoices**

*Purpose & Benefits:* This feature will allow users to generate professional PDF versions of their invoices and optionally email them directly to clients from within the application. It enhances professionalism, offers convenience, saves time, and aids in record-keeping.

*Key Functionalities:*
    *   Generate and download well-formatted PDF versions of any invoice.
    *   Optionally, send the generated PDF invoice directly to a client's email address from the application, with customizable email templates.
    *   Track whether an invoice has been emailed.

**Feature 3: Recurring Invoices**

*Purpose & Benefits:* This feature enables users to set up invoices that are automatically generated and (optionally) sent on a predefined schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly). It automates repetitive billing, helps improve cash flow predictability, reduces manual errors, and enhances client relationships through consistent billing.

*Key Functionalities:*
    *   Define recurrence schedules (frequency, start/end dates, day of month) for invoices.
    *   Automatic generation of new invoices based on recurring templates, with updated dates and new invoice numbers.
    *   Manage recurring invoice templates (view, pause, resume, edit, cancel).
