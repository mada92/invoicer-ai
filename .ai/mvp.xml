    <section title="Core Problem">
        <problem_statement>
            Addresses the challenge of manually creating invoices using traditional forms, which can be inconvenient or impossible in situations where hands-free operation is needed (e.g., while driving, working on-site). The core goal is to enable users to generate invoices quickly and efficiently using voice commands.
