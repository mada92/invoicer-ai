<prd title="Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Invoicer AI">
    <productOverview>
        <paragraph>
            Invoicer AI is a web application designed to streamline the invoice creation process using voice commands. The application targets users who need a quick and convenient way to generate invoices in situations where manual data entry is difficult or impossible (e.g., working in the field, driving). The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version will be available as a web application exclusively in desktop view. The goal is to enable users to dictate invoice data, which is then automatically transcribed, interpreted by AI (using OpenAI Whisper and gpt-4o-mini), and saved in a system linked to the user's account (authenticated via Supabase Auth). The application also integrates with the GUS API (Polish Central Statistical Office) to verify contractor data.

    <userProblem>
        <paragraph>
            The main problem Invoicer AI solves is the challenge associated with manually creating invoices using traditional forms. This can be inconvenient or impossible in situations requiring hands-free operation (e.g., while driving, working on-site with a client). The primary objective is to allow users to generate invoices quickly and efficiently using voice commands, eliminating the need for manual data entry on small screens or in uncomfortable conditions.
